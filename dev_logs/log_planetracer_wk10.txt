- Worked on creating a help page with Uzair
	- Created an expansion tile widget that uses a nested List of entries 
	to create an interactive widget that a user can utilize if they need help with utilizing the app
	- Added it to the navigation bar
	- Will most likely be moving it into settings
- Started mapping out resources to include in this page, or in a seperate resources page
