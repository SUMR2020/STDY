- Researched the firebase database

February 16th, 2020: 3pm to 12:30am
- Researched into list views and firestore array fields
- converted dates array from firestore into DateTime array to see if the array has the current day in it
- if so add it to the list of tasks for the day
- created a list view for the tasks for today
- we had some github issues, so I had to redo my code and do a lot of debugging, this took quite some time
- Added the time/amount field in the to do list
