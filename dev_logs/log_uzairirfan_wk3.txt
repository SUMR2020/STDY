Spent around 11 hours over the course of 2 days trying to implement app wide dark mode and light mode. I have successfully created themes and implemented a settings page to enable the user to switch between themes. There is also a third theme option for OLED making the background pure black. 

I spent 5 hours implementing shared_preferences to save the theme so it is the same when you return. During this time I changed the appbar and helped RC with her calendar plugin.
