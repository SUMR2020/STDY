Spent about an hour fixing the master branch, because merging 2 prs was not working correctly.

Spent another hour figuring out how to fix login so you can not access the app without a google account.

Spent 3 hours implementing a splash screen animation and a custom icon, as well as making so if you are signed in, ou are not taken back to the login screen each time.
